# ResNet18_Image_Classification
This repository contains the implementation of the ResNet-18 architecture for image classification, specifically targeting a dataset with three classes: dogs, cars, and food. The ResNet-18 model is trained on a dataset consisting of 30,000 samples (10,000 per class), each image sized 64x64.
